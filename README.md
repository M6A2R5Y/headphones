- In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.
- won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want 
- the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
# Requirements
- you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript

Important notes with Figma:

- if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
- some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md
